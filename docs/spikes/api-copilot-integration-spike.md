# GitHub Copilot Chat Extension API Integration

## Summary

**Spike Objective:** Determine if GitHub Copilot Chat extension exposes programmatic APIs that allow other VS Code extensions to call Copilot Agent modes and integrate with chat functionality.

**Why This Matters:** The entire VoicePilot architecture depends on being able to programmatically interact with GitHub Copilot. If direct API access isn't available, we may need to redesign the approach or find alternative integration methods.

**Timebox:** 2 weeks

**Decision Deadline:** End of Week 2 - This is a critical blocker for the VS Code extension approach and must be resolved before proceeding with development.

## Research Question(s)

**Primary Question:** What programmatic APIs does the GitHub Copilot Chat extension expose to other VS Code extensions?

**Secondary Questions:**

- Can we invoke specific Copilot Agent modes (like @vscode, @workspace) programmatically?
- What authentication and permission models apply to extension-to-extension communication?
- Are there rate limits or usage restrictions for programmatic access?
- Can we access conversation history and context from other extensions?
- What events and hooks are available for monitoring Copilot interactions?

## Investigation Plan

### Research Tasks

- [ ] Examine GitHub Copilot Chat extension source code and documentation
- [ ] Review VS Code Extension API documentation for inter-extension communication
- [ ] Analyze Copilot Chat extension's package.json for exposed commands and APIs
- [ ] Test VS Code extension API methods: `vscode.commands.executeCommand` with Copilot commands
- [ ] Create minimal test extension to attempt Copilot integration
- [ ] Research VS Code's `vscode.chat` API and its relationship to Copilot
- [ ] Investigate extension activation events and dependency management
- [ ] Document all available integration points and their capabilities
- [ ] Test authentication flow and permission requirements

### Success Criteria

**This spike is complete when:**

- [ ] Complete inventory of available Copilot integration APIs documented
- [ ] Working proof of concept extension that can interact with Copilot
- [ ] Clear understanding of integration limitations and constraints
- [ ] Alternative approaches documented if direct API access is limited
- [ ] Clear recommendation on feasibility of VS Code extension approach

## Technical Context

**Related Components:**
- VS Code Extension Host
- GitHub Copilot Chat Extension
- VoicePilot AI Manager Agent
- Chat Integration Layer
- Prompt Processing Pipeline

**Dependencies:**
- All other technical spikes depend on the outcome of this research
- Architecture decisions for the entire VoicePilot system
- Choice between VS Code extension vs. external tool approach

**Constraints:**
- Must work within VS Code extension security model
- Cannot modify or patch GitHub Copilot Chat extension
- Must respect GitHub's terms of service and API usage policies
- Need to handle potential API changes in future Copilot updates
