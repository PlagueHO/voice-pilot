# Cross-Platform Audio Support in VS Code Extensions

## Summary

**Spike Objective:** Validate that audio capture and playback works consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux within VS Code extension contexts, with consistent user experience for permissions and audio quality.

**Why This Matters:** VoicePilot must work reliably across all platforms that VS Code supports. Inconsistent audio behavior or permission handling would create a fragmented user experience and limit adoption on certain platforms.

**Timebox:** 2 weeks

**Decision Deadline:** End of Week 5 - This validates the cross-platform viability of the VS Code extension approach and informs platform-specific implementation requirements.

## Research Question(s)

- Electron audio support patterns since VS Code is Electron-based
- Azure OpenAI Realtime API integration requirements across platforms
- Existing VS Code audio extension implementations and patterns

**Initial Assessment:** VS Code extensions run in a constrained environment that may limit direct audio access. Need to investigate webview contexts, extension host capabilities, and Electron's audio bridging mechanisms.

**Web Audio API Cross-Platform Status (2025-09-17):**

- **Browser Support**: Web Audio API has baseline support across all major browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari)
- **Platform Availability**: API works on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android
- **Key Components for Audio Capture**:
  - `MediaStreamAudioSourceNode` - for capturing audio from microphones via getUserMedia()
  - `AudioContext` - cross-platform audio processing graph
  - `MediaStream` API integration for real-time audio capture
- **Cross-Platform Considerations**:
  - All major browsers support Web Audio API with consistent interface
  - AudioContext creation requires user gesture for security (autoplay restrictions)
  - Performance characteristics vary by platform but API surface is consistent
  - Mobile platforms (iOS/Android) have additional permission requirements

**Microsoft Documentation Findings:**

- Azure Communication Services Calling SDK supports Electron on Windows, macOS (✅)
- Electron audio support is officially documented and tested
- No Linux support mentioned for Azure Communication Services Electron integration (❌)
- Audio capture in browser contexts works through MediaStream API

**getUserMedia() Cross-Platform Status (2025-09-17):**

- **Security Requirements**: HTTPS/TLS required - getUserMedia only works in secure contexts
- **Permission Model**: User permission always required, browsers show persistent indicators during capture
- **Platform Support**: Baseline support across Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari on all platforms
- **Key Constraints**:
  - Cannot work in sandboxed iframes without `allow-same-origin` sandbox attribute
  - Document must be fully active and securely loaded
  - Permissions Policy controls access in iframe contexts
- **Error Handling**: Well-defined exceptions for different failure modes across platforms
- **Device Access**: Supports device enumeration, device selection, and capability constraints
- **Privacy Indicators**: All platforms show visual/audio indicators when microphone is active

**VS Code Extension Audio Capabilities (2025-09-17):**

✅ **CONFIRMED: VS Code extensions CAN access audio through webviews**

- **Webview Context**: Extensions can create webviews with full Web API access including getUserMedia()
- **Production Evidence**: Microsoft VS Code Speech extension (1M+ installs) uses webview for audio
- **Architecture Pattern**: Extension host handles VS Code integration, webview handles audio processing
- **Message Passing**: Bidirectional communication between extension host and webview for data exchange
- **CSP Configuration**: Content Security Policy allows media-src and microphone access
- **Performance Isolation**: Audio processing in webview doesn't impact VS Code editor performance
- **Cross-Platform**: Same webview approach works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

**Platform-Specific Audio Subsystems Analysis (2025-09-17):**

✅ **Audio subsystems abstracted by browser engine - no direct impact on VS Code extensions**

- **Windows (WASAPI)**: Microsoft Core Audio APIs provide low-latency audio, but webview audio goes through Chromium/Electron, not direct WASAPI access
- **macOS (Core Audio)**: Apple's Core Audio framework handles audio, but again abstracted through browser engine
- **Linux (ALSA/PulseAudio)**: Advanced Linux Sound Architecture or PulseAudio, but webview uses system audio through Chromium
- **Key Finding**: VS Code extensions using webviews don't directly interact with platform audio subsystems
- **Browser Abstraction**: Chromium/Electron handles all platform-specific audio integration
- **Consistent API Surface**: getUserMedia() and Web Audio API provide same interface regardless of underlying audio system
- **Performance**: Browser engine optimizations mean similar performance characteristics across platforms
- **Hardware Access**: Device enumeration and capability detection work consistently through MediaDevices API

**Audio Permission Models Cross-Platform Analysis (2025-09-17):**

✅ **Consistent permission model across all platforms with browser-managed security**

- **Universal Security Requirements**:
  - HTTPS/TLS required for all getUserMedia() access (secure contexts only)
  - User permission always required on first access per domain
  - Visual/audio indicators required when microphone is active across all platforms
- **Platform-Specific Permission UI**:
  - **Windows**: Browser-managed permission dialogs, integration with Windows privacy settings
  - **macOS**: Browser permission + potential macOS system permission for microphone access
  - **Linux**: Browser permission + potential system audio permissions (varies by distribution)
- **VS Code Context**:
  - Webviews inherit browser permission model (Chromium/Electron)
  - Extension host cannot bypass permission requirements
  - CSP headers can restrict or allow audio access (`media-src` directive)
- **Permissions Policy**: Iframe contexts (like webviews) can be restricted via `allow="microphone"` attribute
- **Cross-Domain Considerations**: VS Code webviews have controlled origin, simplifying permission management

**Existing VS Code Audio Extensions Analysis (2025-09-17):**

✅ **Multiple production extensions confirm cross-platform audio feasibility**

```vscode-extensions
ms-vscode.vscode-speech,ark-tik.multiline-cursor-audio-visualizer,0xluffyb.interview-mic,arcsine.chronicler,serenade.serenade,bridgeconn.scribe-audio
