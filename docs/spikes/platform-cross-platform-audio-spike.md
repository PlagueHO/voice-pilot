# Cross-Platform Audio Support in VS Code Extensions

## Summary

**Spike Objective:** Validate that audio capture and playback works consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux within VS Code extension contexts, with consistent user experience for permissions and audio quality.

**Why This Matters:** VoicePilot must work reliably across all platforms that VS Code supports. Inconsistent audio behavior or permission handling would create a fragmented user experience and limit adoption on certain platforms.

**Timebox:** 2 weeks

**Decision Deadline:** End of Week 5 - This validates the cross-platform viability of the VS Code extension approach and informs platform-specific implementation requirements.

## Research Question(s)

**Primary Question:** Does audio capture and playback work consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux within VS Code extensions?

**Secondary Questions:**

- How do audio permission prompts differ across operating systems?
- Are there platform-specific audio API limitations or capabilities?
- What are the audio quality and latency differences between platforms?
- How do different audio hardware configurations affect compatibility?
- What are the differences in microphone and speaker enumeration across platforms?
- How do system audio settings impact extension audio access?
- Are there platform-specific security or privacy restrictions?

## Investigation Plan

### Research Tasks

- [ ] Test audio capture on Windows (Windows 10, Windows 11, multiple versions)
- [ ] Test audio capture on macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon, multiple OS versions)
- [ ] Test audio capture on Linux (Ubuntu LTS, Fedora, other popular distributions)
- [ ] Verify audio permission prompts and user experience flow on each platform
- [ ] Test audio quality and consistency across different hardware configurations
- [ ] Evaluate microphone and speaker device enumeration on each platform
- [ ] Test edge cases: Bluetooth headsets, USB microphones, integrated audio
- [ ] Measure audio latency characteristics per platform
- [ ] Document platform-specific implementation requirements
- [ ] Create cross-platform compatibility matrix

### Success Criteria

**This spike is complete when:**

- [ ] Audio functionality tested and documented on all three major platforms
- [ ] Platform-specific permission handling patterns documented
- [ ] Audio quality and performance benchmarks completed for each platform
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility matrix created with known limitations
- [ ] Platform-specific implementation guidance documented
- [ ] Clear recommendation on cross-platform feasibility provided

## Technical Context

**Related Components:**

- VS Code Extension Host (cross-platform)
- Web Audio API implementation across platforms
- MediaStream API platform variations
- Operating system audio subsystems (WASAPI, Core Audio, ALSA/PulseAudio)
- VoicePilot Audio Capture Service
- Audio Processing Pipeline

**Dependencies:**

- Platform Audio Capabilities spike must validate basic audio access first
- Results inform Azure OpenAI integration requirements for each platform
- Affects user experience design for permission flows
- Impacts deployment and testing strategies

**Constraints:**

- Must work within VS Code's cross-platform extension model
- Cannot require platform-specific native modules or dependencies
- Must handle different audio permission models gracefully
- Need consistent user experience across platforms
- Must work with standard audio hardware configurations
- Performance requirements must be met on all platforms
