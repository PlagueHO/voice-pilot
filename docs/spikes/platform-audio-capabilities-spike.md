# VS Code Extension Audio Capabilities

## Summary

**Spike Objective:** Determine if VS Code extensions can access microphone and perform real-time audio processing within the extension host environment or through webviews.

**Why This Matters:** VoicePilot's core functionality depends on capturing and processing audio input. If VS Code extensions cannot reliably access audio APIs, the entire VS Code extension approach becomes unfeasible.

**Timebox:** 2 weeks

**Decision Deadline:** End of Week 2 - This is a critical technical blocker that determines if the VS Code extension architecture is viable for audio-based applications.

## Research Question(s)

**Primary Question:** Can VS Code extensions access microphone and perform real-time audio processing with acceptable performance and reliability?

**Secondary Questions:**

- What audio APIs are available within the VS Code extension security model?
- Can extensions access microphone directly or only through webview contexts?
- What are the performance characteristics of audio processing in extension host vs. webview?
- How do audio permissions work across different operating systems?
- What are the latency implications of different audio access methods?
- Can extensions handle continuous audio streaming without affecting VS Code performance?

## Investigation Plan

### Research Tasks

- [ ] Research VS Code extension security model and media access policies
- [ ] Examine Web Audio API availability in VS Code extension contexts
- [ ] Create prototype extension with basic microphone access using Web APIs
- [ ] Test audio capture performance in webview vs. extension host contexts
- [ ] Evaluate audio processing capabilities (recording, streaming, format conversion)
- [ ] Test cross-platform audio permission handling (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [ ] Measure audio latency and quality across different access methods
- [ ] Test impact on VS Code performance during continuous audio processing
- [ ] Document audio API limitations and workarounds

### Success Criteria

**This spike is complete when:**

- [ ] Clear documentation of available audio APIs and access methods
- [ ] Working proof of concept extension demonstrating microphone access
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for audio processing in VS Code context
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility assessment completed
- [ ] Clear recommendation on feasibility of audio processing in VS Code extensions
- [ ] Alternative approaches documented if direct audio access is limited

## Technical Context

**Related Components:**
- VS Code Extension Host
- Web Audio API
- MediaStream API
- VoicePilot Audio Capture Service
- Azure OpenAI Realtime API Integration
- Audio Processing Pipeline

**Dependencies:**
- Azure OpenAI Realtime API integration spike depends on audio input capabilities
- Overall VS Code extension vs. external tool decision
- Performance requirements and user experience design

**Constraints:**
- VS Code extension security model restrictions
- Cross-platform compatibility requirements
- Real-time audio processing performance needs
- User privacy and permission requirements
- Need to maintain VS Code editor responsiveness
