# Azure OpenAI Realtime API Integration from VS Code Extension

## Summary

**Spike Objective:** Determine if Azure OpenAI's WebRTC Realtime API can be successfully integrated from within a VS Code extension context, including authentication, connection establishment, and real-time audio streaming.

**Why This Matters:** The Azure OpenAI Realtime API is the core technology for speech-to-text functionality in VoicePilot. If this integration isn't possible from VS Code extensions due to security model limitations, the entire audio processing architecture needs to be reconsidered.

**Timebox:** 2 weeks

**Decision Deadline:** End of Week 3 - This determines the feasibility of real-time AI audio processing within VS Code extensions and affects the overall technical architecture.

## Research Question(s)

**Primary Question:** Can VS Code extensions establish and maintain WebRTC connections to Azure OpenAI's Realtime API for real-time audio processing?

**Secondary Questions:**

- Does the VS Code extension security model allow WebRTC connections to external services?
- How can Azure OpenAI authentication be handled securely within extension context?
- What are the performance characteristics of WebRTC audio streaming from extensions?
- Can extensions handle the required ephemeral key management for Azure OpenAI sessions?
- What are the latency implications of routing audio through the extension host?
- How reliable are WebRTC connections when initiated from VS Code extensions?
- Can extensions handle real-time bidirectional audio streaming without affecting VS Code performance?

## Investigation Plan

### Research Tasks

- [ ] Review Azure OpenAI Realtime API documentation and requirements
- [ ] Research VS Code extension security model for WebRTC and external connections
- [ ] Test WebRTC connection establishment from basic VS Code extension
- [ ] Implement Azure OpenAI authentication flow within extension security constraints
- [ ] Create proof of concept extension with basic Realtime API connection
- [ ] Test real-time audio streaming to and from Azure OpenAI endpoints
- [ ] Measure latency, connection stability, and audio quality
- [ ] Evaluate ephemeral key management and session lifecycle
- [ ] Test impact on VS Code performance during continuous audio streaming
- [ ] Document integration patterns, limitations, and workarounds

### Success Criteria

**This spike is complete when:**

- [ ] Working proof of concept extension demonstrating Azure OpenAI Realtime API connection
- [ ] Authentication flow successfully implemented and tested
- [ ] Real-time audio streaming functionality validated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks and latency measurements documented
- [ ] Clear recommendation on integration feasibility and approach
- [ ] Alternative solutions documented if direct integration is not viable

## Technical Context

**Related Components:**

- Azure OpenAI Realtime API (GPT-4o-realtime-preview)
- VS Code Extension Host
- WebRTC Client Implementation
- Ephemeral Key Manager
- Audio Processing Pipeline
- VoicePilot STT Service

**Dependencies:**

- VS Code Extension Audio Capabilities spike (platform-audio-capabilities-spike.md)
- Audio input must be available before Azure integration can be tested
- Overall architecture decision depends on this integration working
- Performance requirements depend on this API's capabilities

**Constraints:**

- VS Code extension security model restrictions on external connections
- Azure OpenAI API rate limits and session management requirements
- WebRTC connection establishment and firewall considerations
- Ephemeral key lifecycle (1-minute validity) management
- Real-time performance requirements for conversational audio
- Need to maintain VS Code responsiveness during audio processing
