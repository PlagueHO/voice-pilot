## Introduction

This specification defines deterministic cleanup and disposal semantics for VoicePilot services, transports, UI components, and audio pipelines. The goal is to guarantee predictable teardown behavior, prevent resource leaks, and preserve session integrity when conversations end, failures occur, or the extension deactivates.

## 1. Purpose & Scope

The specification establishes ordering, orchestration, and verification rules for cleaning up runtime resources across the VoicePilot extension host and webview contexts.

- Covers lifecycle hooks for `ServiceInitializable` implementations, WebRTC transports, audio worklets, timers, and storage handles.
- Applies to session shutdown, error recovery, extension deactivation, and configuration reloads that require component recycling.
- Specifies telemetry and diagnostic expectations that confirm cleanup completion.

**Intended Audience**: Extension engineers, audio subsystem owners, and QA teams validating lifecycle behavior.

**Assumptions**:

- Session management (SP-005), WebRTC transport (SP-006), audio capture pipeline (SP-007), and conversation state machine (SP-012) are implemented according to their specifications.
- Components implement the `ServiceInitializable` contract and expose `dispose()` semantics.
- VS Code extension host provides `ExtensionContext` disposables and storage mechanisms.
- Webview context operates with Web Audio API 1.1 and WebRTC APIs available.

## 2. Definitions

- **Disposal Plan**: Ordered collection of cleanup steps grouped by resource type and dependency relationships.
- **Deterministic Shutdown**: Cleanup process that yields the same resulting state regardless of prior runtime variance.
- **Idempotent Disposal**: Property ensuring repeated disposal calls have no adverse side effects or resource resurrection.
- **Critical Resource**: Resource whose leakage causes security exposure, crash, or user-visible degradation (e.g., credentials, sockets).
- **Grace Period**: Time budget allocated for asynchronous cleanup before forced termination.
- **Cleanup Telemetry**: Structured metrics and logs emitted during disposal to prove completion and capture anomalies.
- **Scoped Disposable**: Helper abstraction tying lifecycle of related disposable resources to a parent scope.
- **Orphan Detector**: Diagnostic routine that verifies no active timers, intervals, or audio nodes remain after cleanup.

## 3. Requirements, Constraints & Guidelines

### Core Requirements

- **REQ-001**: Every `ServiceInitializable` implementation SHALL provide an idempotent `dispose()` that releases all owned resources.
- **REQ-002**: Disposal plans SHALL execute in dependency order: configuration → authentication → transport → session → UI.
- **REQ-003**: Cleanup sequences SHALL complete within a 2-second grace period unless an explicit override is configured.
- **REQ-004**: Disposed components SHALL emit `disposalCompleted` diagnostics to the telemetry bus with duration, outcomes, and orphan counts.
- **REQ-005**: Resource cleanup SHALL be triggered on session end, fatal error recovery, extension deactivation, and configuration reloads that replace service instances.
- **REQ-006**: Disposal SHALL not reinitialize resources; creation must be handled by activation flows only.
- **REQ-007**: Cleanup orchestration SHALL survive partial failures by continuing to dispose remaining components and aggregating errors.

### Security Requirements

- **SEC-001**: Credentials, tokens, and ephemeral keys SHALL be invalidated or purged from memory and `SecretStorage` on disposal completion.
- **SEC-002**: Audio buffers and transcript fragments SHALL be zeroed or released to prevent sensitive data retention.
- **SEC-003**: Cleanup telemetry SHALL exclude secrets while still indicating which resources were cleared.

### Constraints

- **CON-001**: Forced termination SHALL occur if cleanup exceeds the grace period by more than 1 second, logging a high-severity warning and marking pending disposals.
- **CON-002**: Cleanup sequences SHALL run on the extension host thread; webview cleanup must be coordinated via message contracts defined in SP-050.
- **CON-003**: Timers and intervals SHALL be tracked through a central registry to allow bulk disposal.
- **CON-004**: Outside dependencies (e.g., VS Code disposables) SHALL be released before custom resources to avoid callback invocation after teardown.

### Guidelines

- **GUD-001**: Group related disposables using scoped helpers (`DisposableScope`, `CompositeDisposable`) to reduce ordering mistakes.
- **GUD-002**: Wrap asynchronous cleanup steps in retryable helpers with capped attempts to handle transient failures (aligns with SP-037).
- **GUD-003**: Surface cleanup status to the conversation state machine so UI can transition to a resolved state.
- **GUD-004**: Provide verbose cleanup logging in development mode while keeping production logs concise.

### Patterns

- **PAT-001**: Use the Template Method pattern for disposal pipelines to enforce ordering while allowing resource-specific overrides.
- **PAT-002**: Apply the Observer pattern to notify interested components when cleanup starts and finishes.
- **PAT-003**: Embed orphan detection checks at the end of disposal to fail tests when lingering resources are detected.

## 4. Interfaces & Data Contracts

### Disposal Orchestrator Contract

```typescript
export interface DisposalStepResult {
  name: string;
  durationMs: number;
  success: boolean;
  error?: Error;
  orphanCounts?: Partial<OrphanSnapshot>;
}

export interface OrphanSnapshot {
  timers: number;
  audioNodes: number;
  mediaStreams: number;
  dataChannels: number;
  disposables: number;
}

export interface DisposalOrchestrator extends ServiceInitializable {
  register(resource: ScopedDisposable): void;
  disposeAll(reason: DisposalReason, options?: DisposalOptions): Promise<DisposalReport>;
}

export interface ScopedDisposable {
  id: string;
  priority: number; // Lower executes earlier
  dispose(reason: DisposalReason): Promise<void> | void;
  isDisposed(): boolean;
}

export type DisposalReason =
  | 'session-end'
  | 'extension-deactivate'
  | 'fatal-error'
  | 'config-reload';

export interface DisposalOptions {
  gracePeriodMs?: number;
  auditTrailId?: string;
}

export interface DisposalReport {
  reason: DisposalReason;
  startedAt: number;
  completedAt: number;
  steps: DisposalStepResult[];
  aggregatedError?: Error;
  orphanSnapshot: OrphanSnapshot;
}
```

### Telemetry Event Schema (JSON)

```json
{
  "eventName": "voicepilot.cleanup.completed",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-11T00:00:00.000Z",
  "reason": "session-end",
  "durationMs": 742,
  "success": true,
  "orphanSnapshot": {
    "timers": 0,
    "audioNodes": 0,
    "mediaStreams": 0,
    "dataChannels": 0,
    "disposables": 0
  },
  "steps": [
    { "name": "session-manager", "durationMs": 120, "success": true },
    { "name": "webrtc-transport", "durationMs": 210, "success": true },
    { "name": "audio-pipeline", "durationMs": 300, "success": true },
    { "name": "ui", "durationMs": 112, "success": true }
  ]
}
```

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- **AC-001**: Given an active conversation, When `disposeAll('session-end')` is invoked, Then all registered scopes report `isDisposed() === true` within the grace period.
- **AC-002**: Given a simulated transport failure, When disposal runs, Then WebRTC connections close and orphan detection reports zero active data channels.
- **AC-003**: Given a configuration reload, When disposal executes, Then credentials, timers, and audio nodes tied to the prior configuration are invalidated before new initialization begins.
- **AC-004**: Given repeated calls to `disposeAll`, When the second call executes, Then no additional telemetry errors occur and the aggregated report indicates idempotent completion.
- **AC-005**: Given a forced termination scenario exceeding the grace period, When disposal escalates, Then a high-severity log entry is produced and pending disposables are marked for manual inspection.

## 6. Test Automation Strategy

- **Test Levels**: Unit tests cover orchestrator ordering and idempotency; integration tests validate cleanup across session, transport, and UI boundaries; end-to-end automation ensures extension deactivate disposes resources.
- **Frameworks**: Mocha with Chai assertions and Sinon fakes per repository standard; use Playwright or VS Code Test Runner for end-to-end scenarios involving webview cleanup.
- **Test Data Management**: Create ephemeral mocks for transports and audio nodes; ensure timers are stubbed via fake clocks to validate grace periods.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Integrate cleanup tests into the Quality Gate sequence; fail the build if orphan detection reports non-zero counts.
- **Coverage Requirements**: Maintain ≥90% statement coverage on disposal orchestrator modules and ≥85% branch coverage for cleanup paths.
- **Performance Testing**: Measure disposal duration under load (simulated concurrent sessions) to confirm sub-2-second completion.

## 7. Rationale & Context

Deterministic resource disposal ensures VoicePilot avoids memory leaks, dangling transports, and inconsistent session state. Aligning cleanup with SP-005's session lifecycle prevents conflicts during credential renewal. SP-006 mandates WebRTC resource release to avoid ICE failures, while SP-007 and SP-012 rely on teardown signals to reset audio pipelines and conversation states. Structured disposal telemetry enables rapid incident resolution and regression detection.

## 8. Dependencies & External Integrations

### External Systems

- **EXT-001**: Azure OpenAI Realtime endpoints – connections must be gracefully closed and authentication tokens invalidated.

### Third-Party Services

- **SVC-001**: VS Code SecretStorage – secrets cleared on disposal.

### Infrastructure Dependencies

- **INF-001**: VS Code extension host lifecycle – provides extension deactivate hook for top-level cleanup.

### Data Dependencies

- **DAT-001**: Telemetry storage (local JSON artifacts) – receives cleanup completion events for diagnostics.

### Technology Platform Dependencies

- **PLT-001**: Web Audio API 1.1 – audio node teardown must respect platform-specific release semantics.
- **PLT-002**: WebRTC APIs – ensure peer connections and data channels close per specification.

### Compliance Dependencies

- **COM-001**: Privacy policy (SP-027) – mandates purge of user audio and transcripts during cleanup.

## 9. Examples & Edge Cases

```typescript
// Example: Registering scoped disposables with priority ordering
const scope = orchestrator.register({
  id: 'webrtc-transport',
  priority: 20,
  async dispose(reason) {
    await transport.close(reason);
    await audioGraph.disconnect();
    stopTelemetryPumps();
  },
  isDisposed: () => transport.isClosed()
});

// Edge Case: Partial failure handling during cleanup
try {
  await orchestrator.disposeAll('fatal-error', { gracePeriodMs: 1500 });
} catch (aggregate) {
  logHighSeverity('cleanup.failed', aggregate);
  alertRecoveryOrchestrator();
}
```

## 10. Validation Criteria

- All disposal reports indicate zero orphans across timers, audio nodes, media streams, and data channels.
- Cleanup telemetry events appear in Quality Gate artifacts with success status.
- Unit and integration tests enforce disposal idempotency and ordering.
- Manual activation/deactivation testing shows no lingering processes or memory growth after repeated cycles.
